#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software Engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software applications.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
Development of Programming languages like C and FORTAN - These languages helped programmers to easily command the computers in a human readable language
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960's
The rise of agile software development methodologies in the 200's


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements Collection - This involves gathering and documenting user needs and the system requirements
Design - In this phase a high-level design of a software architecture and the user interface are created.
Implementation - Involves the coding and bringing the design live by programming it in either of the programming kanguages.
Testing - The sosftware passes through a series of tests to check whether it meets the desired quality standards and other functional requirements.
Deployment - In this phase, the software is released to users or the customers.
Maintenance - Involves the support on the use of the software, working on updates and enhancing the functionality of the software.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall model involves sequential approach to development with distict phases flowing downwards like a waterfall. It can be used where there is will be no change of requirements in the software during development and the end product is already known by the developer
Aqile methodology involves an iteretive and incremental approach focused on flexibility collaboration and responding to change. It can be used for long development schedules and when the requirements are expected to change


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes and implements software solutions
A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures a software is of quality by designing and executing test plans
A project manager is in charge of the planning, the execution and the delivery of a software

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments are software suites that provide the tools for writing, debugging and testing softwares. Examples include Visual Studio Code, Intellij and Pycharm
Version Control systems are tools used to track changes to our code and to enable teams to collaborate on a project. Examples include git, Subversion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines
Changin requirements during developments
Technical debt

The above challenges can be overcame by 
1. Regular assessment of goals and timelines and Effective communication between developers to enhance collaboration in moments where a deadline is to be met
2. Using agile development methododlogies
3. Prioritizing of tasks


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is the testing of an individual component in a software
Integration testing is the testing of interactions between different components
System testing is the testing of the entire system as a whole
Acceptance testing is the testing of a software to ensure that it meets user needs and requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting questions or statements to for an AI model so as to get the best possible response from it
Importance of interacting with AI models
They help us enhance our understanding by explaining to us complex or hard concepts like in programming


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt : Tell me more about plants
An improved prompt: Tell me more about xerophyte plants 
The improved prompt is more effective because it is specific to a given type of plants rather than generalizing to all plants.
