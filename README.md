#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software Engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software applications.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
Development of Programming languages like C and FORTAN - These languages helped programmers to easily command the computers in a human readable language
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960's
The rise of agile software development methodologies in the 200's


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements Collection - This involves gathering and documenting user needs and the system requirements
Design - In this phase a high-level design of a software architecture and the user interface are created.
Implementation - Involves the coding and bringing the design live by programming it in either of the programming kanguages.
Testing - The sosftware passes through a series of tests to check whether it meets the desired quality standards and other functional requirements.
Deployment - In this phase, the software is released to users or the customers.
Maintenance - Involves the support on the use of the software, working on updates and enhancing the functionality of the software.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments are software suites that provide the tools for writing, debugging and testing softwares. Examples include Visual Studio Code, Intellij and Pycharm
Version Control systems are tools used to track changes to our code and to enable teams to collaborate on a project. Examples include git, Subversion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
